# Scripts and pipelines for the hets paper
Scripts and Snakemake pipelines associated with the paper of Ament-Vel√°squez et al. "Allorecognition genes drive reproductive isolation in *Podospora anserina*", in preparation.

There are three main [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) pipelines. The first one, `SNPpop.smk`, must be run first. Some of the outputs are used by the other two pipelines. So, the order goes:

    1 - `SNPpop.smk`
    2 - `DiversityStats.smk`
    3 - `PaLD.smk`

Each pipeline in turn depends on a small conda environment(s), as explained in their own README files.

As output of all the pipelines there is a `results` folder that usually contains the figures used in the paper.
