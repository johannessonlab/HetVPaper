# Scripts and pipelines for the het-v paper

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/250273621.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/250273621)

Scripts and Snakemake pipelines associated with the paper of Ament-Vel√°squez et al. "Allorecognition genes drive reproductive isolation in *Podospora anserina*", *Nature Ecology & Evolution*.

There are three main [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) pipelines. The first one, `SNPpop.smk`, must be run first. Some of the outputs are used by the other two pipelines. So, the order goes:

    1 - SNPpop.smk
    2 - DiversityStats.smk
    3 - PaLD.smk

Each pipeline in turn depends on a small conda environment(s), as explained in their own README files.

As output of all the pipelines there is a `results` folder that usually contains the figures used in the paper. 

I ran the pipelines in Uppsala University's supercomputer [UPPMAX](https://uppmax.uu.se/), which has a CentOS Linux operating system with a slurm scheduler. However, they should work fine also in other unix environments.

There are two scripts that are not part of the Snakemake pipelines: `DiversityStats/scripts/PaEcology.R` and `MutantsFertility/scripts/PaMutantsFertility.R`. They have to be run manually and require the input and output names to be changed in order to work!

In addition to the bioinformatic pipelines, the folder `SLiMsimulations` contains the code and simulations using [SLiM 3](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/3/632/5229931) written by Ivain Martinossi.
